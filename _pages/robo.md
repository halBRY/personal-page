## Digital Twins

Much of my current work seeks to control, simulate, and interact with robots through VR. Here, I use NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Unity to create a "digital twin" of a robot, which can then be used to simulate or control the physical hardware. 

Things to include here: 
* The Digital Twin Project
* Rover
* Robotics and Rover Exhibition
