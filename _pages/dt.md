title: "Digital Twin"
---

As part of a collective effort to enable Autonomous Science, I have been working to develop "digital twins" of dexterous robotic systems, where the physical hardware is tightly coupled with a high-fidelity simulation. The simulation environment can then be used to control the robot, monitor an autonomous system, run predictive analyses of future experiments, and enable robot learning.
